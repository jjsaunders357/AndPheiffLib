/**
 * Holds key data from a parsed Collada file.  Unlike the factory, which keep most intermediate data, this only keeps the essential stuff.
 * Additionally, this maps all information to a "name" rather than an "id".
 * id a a guaranteed to be unique and is generated by the authoring software for internally referencing data in one part of the file from another.
 * name is a human readable string which was entered by the person using the authoring software.
 *
 * If name collisions occur:
 * materials - only one material is kept in the map, the others are discarded
 * objects - additional objects, past the 1st one, with the same name are put in the anonymousObjects list
